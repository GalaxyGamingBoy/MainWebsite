            <strong>My name is GalaxyGamingBoy and I do programming as a hobby
            I create websites and games. Fun fact this website you are on is created
            by me, Galaxy. I code in Visual Studio Code and I develop games on Godot.
            I hope you like them, Anyways, I play a few games most notably: Minecraft,
            Geometry Dash, Human Fall Flat, Subnautica, Terraria, Satisfactory and
            many other games. Yea I play a lot of games, Anyways, I have a Youtube Channel,
            Reddit, Steam, Discord all of them I will link below.Also I play Mindustry and 
            I like to make mods of this game. You can suggest an item by completing the form 
            on the Add A Suggestion Button Below as many time you like. Also on the Texture 
            Directory Write N/A and for the type choose item if it is an item, Building if 
            it is a building, etc. Hope this helped :D</strong>
